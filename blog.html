        <br>
      </br>
      The main purpose of this is to allocate budget among media channels with the intent of optimizing KPI. I mainly used linear algebra to try to solve this. I realize I have to work on this still as the math is still lacking, but I wanted to share my work so far so that others will hopefully use it and optimize upon it, and hopefully share their insights with me.

      </br>
      My version of solving the "knapsack problem" and implementing the "greedy algorithm." I tried to make this more fun by putting in what I would maybe want to buy. Value is how much I really want the item and Price is how much it costs.

    Creates a simulation: there are 3 ads of different lengths (10s, 15s, 20s) and each new audience that comes randomly selects an ad to watch. Catch is each ad can only be watched by one person at a time so next person has to wait in line.
