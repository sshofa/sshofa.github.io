          <a href="Budget Allocation Across Media Channels.html">Budget Allocation Across Media Channels</a>
          <br> The main purpose of this is to allocate budget among media channels with the intent of optimizing KPI. I mainly used linear algebra to try to solve this. I realize I have to work on this still as the math is still lacking, but I wanted to share my work so far so that others will hopefully use it and optimize upon it, and hopefully share their insights with me.

          <br> Creates a simulation: there are 3 ads of different lengths (10s, 15s, 20s) and each new audience that comes randomly selects an ad to watch. The catch is each ad can only be watched by one person at a time so the next person has to wait in line.
